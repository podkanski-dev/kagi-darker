# Kagi Darker
## A Dark Glassmorphism Style CSS for Kagi Search

I built this dark theme as I wasn't satisfied with any other theme out there.

This is based on a wonderful theme by [pdanzma](https://github.com/pdanzma/kagi-css), but I've heavily modified and cut it down to suit my tastes, and to fix bugs on mobile in particular.

**Please note that this only works with dark mode, it does not, and will not work with light mode.**
